# Event-Management-System

 Creating a web application for an event management system in PHP
 
# What I Learned:
 
 Used SESSION variables to validate user roles (admin, event manager, attendee) then redirected to designated page.
 
 Used password_hash function to hash user password before storing in database. 
 
 Used SESSION variables to authenticate users. ie: Attendee cannot access the admin-restricted page.
